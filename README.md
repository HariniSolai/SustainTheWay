# SustainTheWay



Hello Everyone Welcome to Sustain the Way!! This websites goal is to help local food pantries around us. By using your zip code we are able to cater to the resources around you both as a consumer and producer. We are able to bridge food pantries to farmers who are experiancing food waste so that the resources are being alocated properly. And the users are also able to access their local pantries arounf them with this servece being able to get into contact with them. 
Donars can also use this website to see the local pantries around them and also view what they may be needing to collect at any given moment bridging the cycle of giving back to our communties





## Inspiration
We were really touched by the food desserts in less deserving communities, so we decided to come up with a more accessible and sustainable way to access healthy, fresh foods.

## What it does
Co-Crop is a website designed to serve as a community hub where members can meet, interact, and share crops with each other. The platform allows users to browse listings for crops in or near their area, enabling them to connect with local growers to schedule meetups for exchanging produce. Additionally, users can contribute to the community by listing their own items for sale on the website.

## How we built it
We created the website using javascript, node.js, express, sqlite3, html and css.

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting the database to the frontend of the website, and overall ui design

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Actually getting a search query to work and display results to the user

## What we learned
How to use Pug and connecting the back-end to the front-end.

## What's next for Co-Crop
We will continue to develop the functionality to fully implement our planned features and continue to improve the UI for the user.
