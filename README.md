# SustainTheWay

Our Mission at Sustain the Way

At Sustain the Way, we are committed to reducing food waste and supporting local communities by connecting food pantries with surplus resources. 
Our platform bridges the gap between farmers with excess food and pantries in need, ensuring better allocation of resources. 
By simply entering a zip code, users can find local pantries, access their services, and get in touch with them directly. 
We also provide donors with an easy way to locate nearby pantries and understand their specific needs.  
Together, we can create a more sustainable and food-secure future.
