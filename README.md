# SustainTheWay

Hello Everyone Welcome to Sustain the Way!! This websites goal is to help local food pantries around us. By using your zip code we are able to cater to the resources around you both as a consumer and producer. We are able to bridge food pantries to farmers who are experiancing food waste so that the resources are being alocated properly. And the users are also able to access their local pantries arounf them with this servece being able to get into contact with them. 
Donars can also use this website to see the local pantries around them and also view what they may be needing to collect at any given moment bridging the cycle of giving back to our communties
